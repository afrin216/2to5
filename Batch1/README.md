Useful utility I use at work. If you have any network issues and want to restart network interface or disconnect and reconnect Wi-FI simply run this script.

If the folder where this script resides is part of global PATH variable, this can be run as 

```
WIN_KEY + R (open run command)
"wireless" 
```
