Useful utility I use at work. 

If you need to stand up a local server to serve jars from your local m2 repo for maven, for example for kitchen tests, then this script
stands up a python server to serve files.

Addr : http://localhost:9999/repository/

```
WIN_KEY + R (open run command)
and then 

startpythonserver

```
