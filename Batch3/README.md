Useful utility I use at work. If you have have the need to switch between different java versions, use this script.
It sets JAVA_HOME variable and prefixes it to global PATH variable for that command window.
If the folder where this script resides is part of global PATH variable, this can be run as 

```
WIN_KEY + R (open run command)
and then 

setjava 16
setjava 18
setjava latest 

```
